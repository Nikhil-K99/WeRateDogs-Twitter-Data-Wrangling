## Project Overview

This project wrangled data from the WeRateDogs Twitter from multiple sources including Twitters API. WeRate dogs is a popular twitter account that posts pictures of dogs and gives them ratings. I gathered all the necessary data and then assessed it for a variety of quality and tidiness issues. After noting down all issues with the data, I proceeded to clean everything needed to have data prepared for analysis. The detailed overview of the wrangling process can be found here.

## What I Learned

Throughout this project I learned how to approach different problems when cleaning and tidying up data. I also gained valuable experience of accessing Twitter's API and picking out specific desired data. I also had to gather data from three different sources and put them together at the end of the cleaning process in order to make disoveries and visualize them during analysis. I was very intrigued by the process of gathering raw data and converting it into interesting insights.
